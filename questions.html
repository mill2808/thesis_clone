                    <p>Roofs of on-farm structures 
                        <ul class=roofs>
                            <li>Make sure the building can bear the weight of the panels</li>
                        <li>South-facing roofs will produce the most energy</li>
                        <li>East and west-facing roofs will produce a sizable amount of energy</li>
                        <li>Panels should never be installed on the north side of a roof</li>

                        <li>Make sure panels are high enough that cattle can go underneath it</li>
                        <li>Can provide shade for livestock</li>
                        <li>Makes non-arable land productive</li>

                        <li>Consider the spacing between and height of panels so that machinery can pass through</li>
                        <li>Panels can provide shade that is ideal for shade-loving crops</li>

                <div class="faq-body">
                    <p>The typical maintenance for solar panels is cleaning and a yearly inspection. Cleanings are 
                        typically done twice a year, unless there is not regular rainfall or they are installed in 
                        an area prone to dirt and debris. </p>

                <div class="faq-body">
                    <p>If there is a drop in productivity, or your electricity bills are 
                        higher than usual, the panels may not be performing properly. The 
                        drop in production indicates there is dirt and debris on the panels, 
                        or that there is a maintenance issue that needs to be addressed. </p>
