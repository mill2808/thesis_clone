                    <p>Roofs of on-farm structures 
                        <ul class=roofs>
                            <li>Make sure the building can bear the weight of the panels</li>
                        <li>South-facing roofs will produce the most energy</li>
                        <li>East and west-facing roofs will produce a sizable amount of energy</li>
                        <li>Panels should never be installed on the north side of a roof</li>

                        <li>Make sure panels are high enough that cattle can go underneath it</li>
                        <li>Can provide shade for livestock</li>
                        <li>Makes non-arable land productive</li>

                        <li>Consider the spacing between and height of panels so that machinery can pass through</li>

                <div class="faq-body">
                    <p>The typical maintenance for solar panels is cleaning and a yearly inspection. Cleanings are 
                        typically done twice a year, unless there is not regular rainfall or they are installed in 
                        an area prone to dirt and debris. </p>

                <div class="faq-body">
                    <p>If there is a drop in productivity, or your electricity bills are 
                        higher than usual, the panels may not be performing properly. </p>
                    <p>The drop in production indicates there is dirt and debris on the panels, 
                        or that there is another maintenance issue that needs to be addressed. </p>
