        <p>Solarfordairy is a tool that aims to support dairy farmers as they experience increasing 
            costs of production and stagnant milk prices. This program aims to help the dairy industry 
            achieve its goal of net zero carbon emissions by 2050 and hopes to protect dairy farmers 
            from the market volatility of increasing electricity prices. </p>
       
        <p>The Michigan Farm Energy Audit Program invites you to learn more about potential savings
             on-farm through the installation of solar technology. Using your energy audit information
              through our program, or the information provided on your electricity bill, you can 
              estimate the cost of installing solar panels on your farm. 
            </p>
            
        <p>Solar panels are meant to be installed on non-arable land, roofs, or be dual-functioning 
            by providing shade for your cows during the hot summer months. Please proceed to the cost 
            calculator for more information.  </p>
